            <h2>From Networks to New Horizons</h2>
            <p>I‚Äôm Yahya Nouri, an engineer with a deep-rooted passion for technology and a three-year journey at Huawei that has shaped my career. With a degree in Electrical Engineering, I‚Äôve always been drawn to unraveling complex systems and crafting innovative solutions. My time at Huawei has taken me from the hands-on world of Radio Access Network (RAN) engineering to the dynamic frontier of cloud computing and AI.</p>
            <p>My career began as an HRAN FO Engineer, where I dove into the intricacies of network topology, troubleshooting issues across GSM, UMTS, LTE, and 5G networks. This role honed my ability to think on my feet and tackle real-time challenges. As a FO Technical Support Engineer, I deepened my expertise in diagnosing and resolving network issues. Later, as a NOC Lead Data Analyst, I embraced automation, leveraging Python to build data pipelines and generate actionable insights through streamlined reporting. My most recent role as an NPM Data Analyst shifted my focus to proactive optimization, where I developed automated dashboards that boosted team efficiency and precision. These experiences sparked my fascination with data-driven systems and set the stage for my pivot to the cloud.</p>
            <p>A period of mandatory military service interrupted my journey, but rather than a setback, it was a time of reflection. It clarified my desire to return to Huawei and channel my energy into the future of edge technology: cloud computing and AI.</p>

            <h2>Embracing the Cloud: A Purposeful Leap</h2>
            <p>My transition to cloud computing was a calculated and self-driven endeavor. Recognizing the transformative power of the cloud, I committed to mastering it with the same rigor I applied to network automation. I crafted detailed study guides and used Anki flashcards to internalize complex concepts efficiently. This disciplined approach enabled me to earn the HCIA Cloud Services certification in just one month‚Äîa testament to my ability to rapidly acquire and apply new skills.</p>

            <h2>Charting the Future with Huawei</h2>
            <p>My diverse experience at Huawei, paired with my proven adaptability, positions me as a strong candidate for a Cloud Engineer role. I‚Äôm eager to contribute to Huawei‚Äôs cloud initiatives while continuing to grow. My immediate goals include pursuing the HCIP Cloud Architecture and HCIA AI certifications to stay at the forefront of Huawei‚Äôs technological vision. I‚Äôm also actively expanding my Linux and programming expertise, a cornerstone for cloud innovation.</p>
            <p>My journey has been defined by solving problems and building smarter systems, and I‚Äôm excited to bring that passion to Huawei‚Äôs cloud endeavors. I‚Äôm equally enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge and resources on Huawei Cloud with colleagues and peers to foster collective growth.</p>
